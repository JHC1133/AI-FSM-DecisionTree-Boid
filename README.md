This project was created as part of an AI for videogames course for my Bachelor's degree.

This project implements core AI techniques in a game environment, focusing on intelligent agent behavior. 
I developed a finite state machine (FSM) with multiple states, along with a decision tree (DT) with various decision outcomes. 
Additionally, I implemented Boid flocking behavior, incorporating steering behaviors such as obstacle avoidance, approach, and wander.
These techniques allow for natural and reactive movement, simulating realistic agent behavior in a dynamic environment. 

The project demonstrates my knowledge of AI patterns and behavior design in game development and was written in C#.
